I have created a widget for the course webpage that runs as a Chrome Extension.
The extension fetches all titles and due dates for homework and milestones using green turtle.
It then determines which deadlines are closest and present this as the next homework and milestone.
Additionally all upcoming deadlines are shown underneath.

As the extension isn't exactly general-purpose, it will only run on the course website.

Visibility of the summary can be toggled using the icon in the address bar

A guide to installing the extension can be found here:
https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked

A screenshot of the running extension has been bundled with the code if you do not wish to install the extension.

The produced javascript (background page and content script) can be found in the src directory.
